# Mind Machine Framework

The mind machine framework is designed to be a
**simple, extensible framework** for developing
bots.


## How is it simple?

The mind machine concept is simple because there are only three
components:

* Keymaker
* Sheep
* Shepherd

These are the three types of objects that you deal with in any
given mind machine (and you should not have to deal with the
Keymaker much).

## How is it extensible?

The concept of "extensible" refers specifically to the use
of inheritance and extended classes. 

We want to keep things as simple as possible, but also build
functionality up into complicated bots. Using base classes
and extending one bit at a time helps us accomplish that.


## How is it POOP-y?

The mind machine libraries are a great illustration of
Python Object-Oriented Programming (POOP) in action.
These are very POOP-y libraries, in that they use
classes to combine minimal functionality into classes.

We will point out the many examples of POOP-y behavior
when we see them in a particular mind machine example.
