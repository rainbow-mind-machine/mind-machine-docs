# Mind Machine Framework

The mind machine framework is designed to be a
**simple, extensible framework** for developing
bots.

## How is it extensible?

The concept of "extensible" refers specifically to the use
of inheritance and extended classes. 

The mind machine philosophy is to keep things as simple
as possible, and add functionality in an incremental way
to keep things easy to understand.

Using inheritance and extending base classes allows us to
build up simple functionality into more complicated bots.


## How is it simple?

The mind machine concept is simple because there are only three
components:

* Keymaker
* Sheep
* Shepherd


## How is it POOP-y?

The mind machine libraries are a great illustration of
Python Object-Oriented Programming (POOP) in action.
These are very POOP-y libraries, in that they use
classes to combine minimal functionality into classes.
